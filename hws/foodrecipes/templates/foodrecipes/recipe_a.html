        <h3>RECIPE NOTES AND TIPS</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-8 offset-2">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Chicken: </b> We much prefer cooking with chicken breast because they are leaner. You may use boneless chicken thighs which will be much tender meat but the calories will vary.</li>
          <li>Want to use beef instead of chicken, you can. Go for lean cuts of beef.</li>
          <li>Use low sodium soy sauce or you can swap it for coconut aminos.</li>
          <li><b>Garlic and ginger:</b>For the best taste and flavor, use fresh garlic and ginger. If you need to work with what you have at home, use 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp ginger.</li>
          <li><b>Add more veggies: </b>We kept this Mongolian chicken recipe really close to what you would get in a restaurant but you may add other veggies like broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, red peppers, or green beans to this Asian chicken stir fry.</li>
          <li><b>Honey:</b>we love using honey but you may use maple syrup. The taste will vary slightly.</li>
          <li>Nutrition facts do not include the rice.</li>
